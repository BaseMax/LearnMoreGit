# LearnMoreGit

Welcome to **LearnMoreGit**, a comprehensive guide to Git commands with clear explanations and practical examples. This README covers essential Git commands for beginners and intermediate users, focusing on real-world usage and understanding.

---

## Git Configuration (`git config`)

`git config` is used to configure Git settings such as user information, proxy settings, and signing keys. These settings help Git identify who is making commits and control other behaviors.

### Common commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "UserName"
```
Set your Git username globally (used in commits).

```bash
git config --global user.email "Email"
```
Set your email globally.

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey sec
```
Set your GPG key for signing commits.

---

## Initialize a Git Repository (`git init`)

Starts a new Git repository by creating a `.git` directory (hidden on Unix-based systems).

### Examples:

```bash
git init
```
Initialize Git repo in current directory.

```bash
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
git init
```
Create a new directory and initialize a Git repo inside.

---

## Adding Files to Git (`git add`)

Stages files to be committed.

### Examples:

```bash

```bash
git add .
```

---

## Commit Changes (`git commit`)

git commit -m "Title" -m "Description"
```
Commit with a title and longer description.

## Revert Changes (`git checkout` and `git reset`)

Restore files or move HEAD pointer.

### Examples:

```bash
git checkout -- fileName
```
Revert file to last committed state.

```bash
git reset commitHash

```bash
git branch -M branchName
